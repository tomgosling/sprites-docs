title: Working with Sprites
description: Beyond the basics—sessions, ports, persistence, and everything you need to build real stuff
---

import { Callout, StatusIcon } from '@/components/react';

After you've made it through the [Quickstart](/quickstart), you've got a working Sprite and a basic idea of how to use it. This guide picks up from there: how to run commands, manage sessions, keep processes alive, and make sure your environment stays consistent over time. The first half covers everything you need to build and deploy real stuff. The rest is there when you're ready to go deeper.

---

## Running Commands and Sessions

Sprites give you three main ways to interact:

### `sprite exec` – One-off commands and automation

Run a single command, wait for it to finish, get the output. Perfect for scripts, package installs, or quick checks.

```bash
sprite exec "ls -la"
sprite exec "npm install express"
sprite exec -tty vim
```

- Blocks until the command completes
- Returns stdout/stderr
- Use for automation or scripting

### `sprite console` – Interactive shell (like SSH)

Opens a full terminal session so you can explore, debug, or run multiple commands.

```bash
sprite console
# Inside:
# $ cd /home/sprite && ls -la && vim myfile.txt
```

- TTY enabled
- Stays open until you exit
- Use for manual work or debugging

### Sessions – Keep things running

All TTY sessions are automatically detachable. Start a command, disconnect with `Ctrl+\`, and reattach later. Great for dev servers, long builds, or background processes.

```bash
sprite exec -tty "npm run dev"   # start a TTY session
# Press Ctrl+\ to detach

sprite sessions list             # list running sessions
sprite s ls                      # short form list sessions
sprite sessions attach <id>      # reattach to session
sprite sessions kill <id>        # kill session
```

## Sprite Lifecycle: Hibernation and Persistence

Sprites automatically hibernate after 30 seconds of inactivity. That means:

### What Persists (and What Doesn't)

<StatusIcon type="check" client:load>**Filesystem persists**: All files, installed packages, git repos, databases—everything on disk stays intact</StatusIcon>
<StatusIcon type="x" client:load>**RAM doesn't persist**: Running processes stop, in-memory data is lost</StatusIcon>
<StatusIcon type="check" client:load>**Network config persists**: Open ports, URL settings, SSH access all remain configured</StatusIcon>

This means you can install dependencies once and they're there forever. But if you're running a web server, it'll need to restart when the Sprite wakes up—that's what TTY sessions are for.

### Wake-up Behavior

Wake-up is fast:

- ~100–500ms for normal wakes
- 1–2s on cold starts

Use TTY sessions to keep things running without hibernating. You can detach with `Ctrl+\` and reattach later to see all the output.

```bash
sprite exec -tty "rails server"
# Press Ctrl+\ to detach, use `sprite sessions attach <id>` to reattach
```

### Idle Detection

If something's running, your Sprite stays awake. Otherwise, it sleeps. That includes:

- Active exec/console commands
- Open TCP connections (like your app's URL)
- Running TTY sessions

## Networking: URLs and Port Forwarding

Every Sprite gets a URL: `https://<name>.sprites.app`

### HTTP Access

```bash
sprite url                      # see URL
sprite url update --auth public # make public
sprite url update --auth default # make private again
```

- Routes to port 8080 by default (or first HTTP port opened)
- Wakes the Sprite on request
- Private by default (auth token required)

<Callout type="warning">
**Security note**: Public URLs expose your Sprite to the internet. Only use public mode for demos, webhooks, or non-sensitive work.
</Callout>

### Port Forwarding

```bash
sprite proxy 5432           # access Sprite's port 5432 at localhost:5432
sprite proxy 3001:3000      # map local 3001 to remote 3000
sprite proxy 3000 8080 5432 # forward multiple ports
```

Use for database access, dev tools, or private ports. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop forwarding.

### Port Conflicts

If a local port is already in use, you'll get an error. Solutions:

1. **Choose a different local port**: `sprite proxy 3001:3000` forwards local 3001 to remote 3000
2. **Stop the conflicting process**: Find what's using the port with `lsof -i :3000` (macOS/Linux)
3. **Kill the old proxy session**: If you have an old proxy still running, stop it first

## Your Environment

Sprites run Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with common tools preinstalled:

- **Languages**: Node.js, Python, Go, Ruby, Rust, Elixir, Java, Bun, Deno
- **AI/CLI Tools**: Claude CLI, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, Cursor
- **Utilities**: Git, curl, wget, vim, and common dev tools

### Filesystem Basics

- **`/home/sprite/`** — your home directory, put your stuff here
- **`/home/sprite/.local/`** — for local binaries and user-installed tools
- **`/opt/`** — good for standalone applications
- **`/var/`** — for databases and application state

Install packages like you would locally:

```bash
sprite exec "pip install pandas numpy"
sprite exec "npm install -g typescript"
sprite exec "cargo install ripgrep"
```

They persist across hibernation. No rebuilds needed.

<Callout type="info">
**Storage space**: Each Sprite has 100 GB of persistent storage. Check usage with:

```bash
sprite exec "df -h"
```
</Callout>

## Managing Sprites

### Set Active Sprite

```bash
sprite use my-sprite
# Now all commands target this sprite
sprite exec "echo hello"
```

### List and Filter

```bash
sprite list
sprite list --prefix "dev-"
```

### Destroy

```bash
sprite destroy my-sprite
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Destruction is irreversible!** All data is permanently deleted: files, packages, checkpoints. No undo.
</Callout>

---

## Checkpoints

Snapshot your Sprite's filesystem so you can roll back later.

```bash
sprite checkpoint create
sprite checkpoint create --comment "before upgrade"
sprite checkpoint list
sprite restore <id>
```

Use before risky changes, upgrades, or experiments.

**What gets saved:**

<StatusIcon type="check" client:load>Entire filesystem (all files, installed packages, databases)</StatusIcon>
<StatusIcon type="check" client:load>File permissions and ownership</StatusIcon>
<StatusIcon type="x" client:load>Running processes (they stop during checkpoint creation)</StatusIcon>
<StatusIcon type="x" client:load>In-memory state</StatusIcon>

**Good to know:**
- Checkpoints count against your storage quota
- Restoring replaces the entire filesystem—changes since the checkpoint are lost
- Creation takes 10–30 seconds depending on data size

## Optional: Going Deeper

These features are useful once you're comfortable.

### Mounting Filesystem Locally

Use SSHFS to mount your Sprite and edit files with your local tools.

**Install SSHFS first:**

```bash
# macOS
brew install macfuse sshfs

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install sshfs

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install fuse-sshfs
```

**Add this helper to your shell config:**

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
sc() {
  local sprite_name="${1:-$(sprite use)}"
  local mount_point="/tmp/sprite-${sprite_name}"
  mkdir -p "$mount_point"
  sshfs -o reconnect,ServerAliveInterval=15,ServerAliveCountMax=3 \
    "sprite@${sprite_name}.sprites.dev:" "$mount_point"
  cd "$mount_point"
}
```

**Unmount when done:**

```bash
umount /tmp/sprite-my-sprite
# macOS may need: diskutil umount /tmp/sprite-my-sprite
```

### Common Error Scenarios

**Connection errors:**
- Check auth: `sprite org auth`
- Verify Sprite exists: `sprite list`
- Wait a moment and retry

**Timeout errors:**
- Be patient on first wake-up (1–2 seconds)
- Check if command actually needs that long

**Sprite won't wake up:**
- Verify it exists with `sprite list`
- Wait 30 seconds and retry
- [Contact support](https://fly.io/dashboard/support) if persistent

**Storage full:**
- Clean up files: `sprite exec "du -sh /home/sprite/*"`
- Delete old checkpoints
- Create a new Sprite for additional workloads

**Quick debugging:**

```bash
sprite exec "ps aux"      # running processes
sprite exec "df -h"       # disk space
sprite exec "free -h"     # memory usage
```

Sprites are meant to feel like your own Linux box in the sky—fast to wake, persistent when you need it, and flexible enough to run whatever weird stack you're building. As you get more comfortable, the advanced features are there when you need them.
