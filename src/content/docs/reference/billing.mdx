Sprites offers flexible billing: **pay-as-you-go** for usage-based pricing with no commitment, or a **subscription plan** with included credits for predictable costs.

## Pay As You Go

Usage-based pricing with no monthly commitment.

- Up to **3 sprites** running concurrently
- Pay only for what you use
- No commitment

<PricingRates />

**Key benefit:** No compute charges while Sprites are hibernated—usage only counts when actively running.

## Subscription Plan

Included credits and higher limits for predictable costs.

| Plan | Price | Concurrent Sprites | CPU Hours | RAM Hours | Storage |
|------|-------|--------------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Level 10** | $20/mo | 10 | 450 hrs | 1,800 GB-hrs | 50 GB |

Overage beyond included credits is billed at the same pay-as-you-go rates above.

## Compute Billing

### How It Works

You're billed for CPU and memory only while:

- A command is actively executing
- A TTY session is open
- A detachable session is running

When your Sprite hibernates, compute billing stops immediately.

Sprites use a fixed resource configuration (8 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM), so compute billing uses those values whenever a Sprite is active.

### Billing Granularity

Compute is billed **per-second** with no minimum. If you run a command for 30 seconds, you pay for exactly 30 seconds.

## Storage Billing

Sprites use a two-tier storage system: **hot storage** for active working data and **storage** for persistent object storage.

### Hot Storage

Hot storage is the local NVMe cache used by the filesystem (JuiceFS) for active working data.

- **Sampled every few seconds** while your Sprite is active
- **Only charged while running**: No hot storage charges when hibernated
- **Automatically managed**: The filesystem handles caching transparently

Hot storage represents the working set of data actively being used during your session.

### Storage

Storage is the object storage bucket where all your Sprite's persistent data lives.

- **Measured hourly** by summing the actual size of all objects in your bucket
- **Always charged**: Storage accrues 24/7, even when hibernated
- **TRIM-friendly**: You only pay for data actually written
- **Deleted files reduce cost**: Deleting files reduces your storage bill

### Starting Allocation

Every Sprite includes 100 GB of storage capacity. Storage does not autoscale yet.

### Typical Usage

| Environment | Hot Storage (active) | Storage | Within Plan? |
|------------|---------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Minimal (OS + tools) | ~1 GB | ~2 GB | Yes |
| Dev environment | ~2 GB | ~5 GB | Yes |
| With datasets | ~3 GB | ~10 GB | Yes |
| Large datasets | ~5 GB | ~60 GB | +10 GB overage |

## Cost Optimization

### Minimize Active Time

```bash
# Bad: Long-running idle session
sprite console
# (leave terminal open for hours while doing other things)

# Good: Run specific commands
sprite exec "npm test"
sprite exec "npm build"
```

### Use Hibernation Effectively

Sprites hibernate after ~30 seconds of inactivity. Close idle TTY sessions and keep workloads scoped to short bursts when possible.

### Clean Up Storage

```bash
# Remove unnecessary files
sprite exec "rm -rf node_modules/.cache"
sprite exec "apt-get clean"
sprite exec "pip cache purge"
```

### Use Checkpoints Wisely

Checkpoints consume storage. Clean up old checkpoints:

```bash
# List checkpoints
sprite checkpoint list

# Keep only what you need
```

## Billing Scenarios

Use the calculator above to model your own usage. Here are some common patterns:

| Scenario | Active Time | CPU Hours/mo | PAYG Cost | Level 10 Plan |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Weekend hacker** | 4 hrs/wk | ~139 hrs | ~$18 | $20 (within plan) |
| **Light CI** | 20 builds × 10 min | ~115 hrs | ~$16 | $20 (within plan) |
| **Part-time dev** | 2 hrs/day, 5 days/wk | ~346 hrs | ~$37 | $20 (within plan) |
| **Full-time dev** | 4 hrs/day, 5 days/wk | ~693 hrs | ~$69 | ~$37 (+overage) |

## Monitoring Usage

Usage and billing information is available through your Fly.io dashboard and organization settings. The CLI and API do not currently expose detailed usage metrics.

## Billing FAQ

**When does billing start?**
> Compute billing starts when you execute a command and stops when the command completes or the Sprite hibernates.

**Do I pay while hibernated?**
> No compute or hot storage charges while hibernated. You only pay for storage (object storage), which accrues 24/7.

**How is storage measured?**
> Hot storage (NVMe cache) is sampled every few seconds while your Sprite is active. Storage (object storage) is measured hourly based on actual data stored, not allocated capacity.

**Are checkpoints billed?**
> Yes, checkpoints count toward your storage usage.

**What happens if I exceed my included credits?**
> You'll be charged overage rates for any usage beyond your plan's included credits. Overage is billed at the rates shown in the Overage Pricing section above.

**Is there a minimum charge?**
> Your subscription plan has a fixed monthly cost. Within your included credits, there's no additional charge—you can run commands as short or long as you need.

**How do I see my bill?**
> Usage and billing information is available through your Fly.io dashboard and organization settings.
