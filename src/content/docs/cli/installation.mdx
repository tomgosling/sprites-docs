import { Callout, LinkCard, CardGrid } from '@/components/react';

The Sprites CLI (`sprite`) is available for macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Quick Install (Recommended)

The easiest way to install the CLI is with our install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://sprites.dev/install.sh | sh
```

The install script automatically:
- Detects your operating system and architecture
- Downloads the latest release binary
- Verifies the SHA256 checksum
- Installs to `~/.local/bin`

<Callout type="info">
After installation, you may need to add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH if it's not already included. The script will provide instructions if needed.
</Callout>

## Manual Installation

For specific versions or manual installation, download binaries from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/superfly/sprite-env/releases).

### macOS / Linux

```bash
# Download and extract the appropriate binary for your platform
tar xzf sprite-<platform>-<arch>.tar.gz
sudo mv sprite /usr/local/bin/
```

### Windows

```powershell
# Download and extract
Expand-Archive sprite-windows-amd64.zip -DestinationPath $env:USERPROFILE\bin

# Add to PATH (run in PowerShell as Administrator)
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";$env:USERPROFILE\bin", "User")
```

## Verify Installation

```bash
sprite --help
```

You should see the help output with available commands.

## Upgrading

If you installed from the direct download links, upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
sprite upgrade
```

To check for updates without installing:

```bash
sprite upgrade --check
```

## Configuration

The CLI stores configuration in `~/.sprites/sprites.json`. This includes:

- Organization tokens
- Current organization selection
- Current sprite selection

### Config File Location

| Platform | Location |
|----------|----------|
| macOS/Linux | `~/.sprites/sprites.json` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\.sprites\sprites.json` |

> **Note:** `config.json` is kept for backward compatibility with older clients, but current versions read/write `sprites.json`.

## Optional: Local Directory Context

The CLI supports a `.sprite` file in your project directory to remember which sprite to use:

```bash
# Set the sprite for current directory
sprite use my-project-sprite
```

This creates a `.sprite` file that the CLI reads automatically. Add `.sprite` to your `.gitignore` as it's user-specific.

## Optional: Mount Helper Function

Add this function to your shell configuration (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`) to easily mount your Sprite's filesystem locally:

```bash
sc() {
  local sprite_name="${1:-$(sprite use)}"
  local mount_point="/tmp/sprite-${sprite_name}"
  mkdir -p "$mount_point"
  sshfs -o reconnect,ServerAliveInterval=15,ServerAliveCountMax=3 \
    "sprite@${sprite_name}.sprites.dev:" "$mount_point"
  cd "$mount_point"
}
```

Usage:

```bash
sc my-sprite  # Mount and cd to sprite's home directory
```

<Callout type="info">
This requires `sshfs` to be installed. On macOS, install with `brew install macfuse sshfs`. On Linux, use your package manager: `apt install sshfs` or `yum install fuse-sshfs`.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied

If you get a permission denied error on macOS or Linux:

```bash
chmod +x sprite
sudo mv sprite /usr/local/bin/
```

### Command Not Found

Ensure the binary is in your PATH:

```bash
# Check if sprite is in PATH
which sprite

# If not, add /usr/local/bin to PATH
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

### macOS Security Warning

On macOS, you may see a security warning when first running the CLI. To allow it:

1. Open System Preferences > Security & Privacy
2. Click "Allow Anyway" next to the message about `sprite`
3. Run `sprite` again and click "Open"

Or use the command line:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/sprite
```
