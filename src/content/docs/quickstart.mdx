import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Callout } from '@/components/react';

This guide shows you how to install the CLI, create your first Sprite, and start running commands. By the end, you'll have a working environment that sticks around between runs, serves traffic over HTTP, and wakes up automatically when you need it.

## Install the CLI

Install with our install script (macOS/Linux):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://sprites.dev/install.sh | sh
```

This auto-detects your platform, downloads the binary with checksum verification, and installs to `~/.local/bin`.

For Windows or manual installation, see [CLI Installation](/cli/installation) or download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/superfly/sprite-env/releases).

Verify installation:

```bash
sprite --help
```

## Authenticate

Sprites uses your Fly.io account for authentication:

```bash
sprite org auth
```

This opens a browser window to authenticate with Fly.io.

<Callout type="info">
If authentication fails, try running `fly auth logout` followed by `fly auth login` first, then retry `sprite org auth`.
</Callout>

## Create Your First Sprite

```bash
sprite create my-first-sprite
```

This creates a new Sprite with default configuration, running and ready to accept commands.

Set it as your active Sprite to avoid adding `-s my-first-sprite` to every command:

```bash
sprite use my-first-sprite
```

## Run Commands

Execute commands in your Sprite:

```bash
# Run a simple command
sprite exec echo "Hello, Sprites!"

# Run multiple commands
sprite exec "cd /tmp && ls -la"

# Open an interactive shell
sprite console
```

## Explore the Environment

Sprites come pre-configured with common development tools:

```bash
# Check available runtimes
sprite exec "node --version && python3 --version && go version"

# Install packages
sprite exec "pip install requests"

# Clone a repository
sprite exec "git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git"
```

## Persistence in Action

Your Sprite's filesystem persists between commands:

```bash
# Create a file
sprite exec "echo 'Hello' > /home/sprite/greeting.txt"

# Later, it's still there
sprite exec "cat /home/sprite/greeting.txt"
```

## View Your Sprite's URL

Every Sprite has a unique HTTP URL:

```bash
sprite url
```

## Manage Sprites

```bash
# List all sprites
sprite list

# Destroy when done
sprite destroy my-first-sprite
```

## Using the SDKs

Beyond the CLI, you can create and manage Sprites programmatically:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="JavaScript">
```javascript
import { SpritesClient } from '@fly/sprites';

const client = new SpritesClient(process.env.SPRITE_TOKEN);

const sprite = await client.createSprite('my-sprite');

// Execute a command
const result = await sprite.execFile('python', ['-c', "print('hello')"]);
console.log(result.stdout);

// Stream output from long-running commands
const cmd = sprite.spawn('bash', ['-c', 'for i in {1..10}; do date +%T; sleep 0.5; done']);
for await (const line of cmd.stdout) {
  process.stdout.write(line);
}

await sprite.delete();
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Go">
```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "os"

    sprites "github.com/superfly/sprites-go"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    client := sprites.New(os.Getenv("SPRITE_TOKEN"))

    sprite, _ := client.CreateSprite(ctx, "my-sprite", nil)
    defer client.DeleteSprite(ctx, "my-sprite")

    // Execute a command
    cmd := sprite.Command("python", "-c", "print('hello')")
    output, _ := cmd.Output()
    fmt.Println(string(output))

    // Stream output from long-running commands
    cmd = sprite.Command("bash", "-c", "for i in {1..10}; do date +%T; sleep 0.5; done")
    stdout, _ := cmd.StdoutPipe()
    cmd.Start()
    io.Copy(os.Stdout, stdout)
    cmd.Wait()
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
