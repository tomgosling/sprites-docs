title: Sprites Overview
description: Persistent, hardware-isolated execution environments for arbitrary code
---

**Sprites are persistent, hardware-isolated Linux environments for running arbitrary code.** It's like having a small, stateful computer you can spin up on demand. Unlike serverless functions, Sprites keep their filesystem and memory between runs. They're useful for things like AI agents, persistent development environments, or user-submitted code.

## What makes Sprites different?

| Feature | Traditional Serverless | Sprites |
|---------|----------------------|---------|
| State | Ephemeral | Persistent |
| Filesystem | Read-only or temporary | Full ext4, persists between runs |
| Startup | Cold starts | Instant wake from hibernation |
| Billing | Per-invocation | Per-second compute, free when idle |
| Environment | Fixed container | Full Linux with any tools |

## Use Cases

Sprites are ideal for:

- **AI Code Execution** - Running code generated by language models (like Claude Code) in isolated, secure environments
- **Untrusted Code** - Isolating and executing user-submitted code safely without risking the rest of your system
- **Development Environments** - Building persistent development environments that maintain state between sessions
- **Long-lived Services** - Hosting services that hibernate automatically and resume on request
- **CI/CD Tasks** - Testing code against live git repositories with full environment access

## Core Concepts

### Persistence

Every Sprite has a persistent, standard ext4 filesystem. During execution, data is written to fast NVMe storage. When the Sprite hibernates, that data is backed up to durable object storage and automatically restored when it wakes up.

### Automatic Hibernation

Sprites automatically hibernate after a period of inactivity (30 seconds by default). While hibernated, there are no compute charges and your full filesystem is preserved. The Sprite wakes instantly on the next request.

### HTTP Access

Every Sprite gets a unique URL, making it easy to expose web services or APIs running inside, without a lot of extra setup.

## Get Started

- **[Quickstart](/quickstart)** - Install the CLI, create your first Sprite, and learn about all the features
- **[JavaScript SDK](/sdks/javascript)** - Build with Sprites in Node.js applications
- **[Go SDK](/sdks/go)** - Use the native Go client mirroring os/exec
- **[CLI Reference](/cli/commands)** -Review the complete command documentation
